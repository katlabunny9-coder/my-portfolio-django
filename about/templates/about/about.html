<div class="about-section">
    <p>
        Hi, I’m <strong>Bunny Katla</strong>, a BCA graduate with a strong interest in
        <strong>Data Analytics, Python, and Web Development</strong>.
        I enjoy building real-world projects that combine clean UI with solid backend logic.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have hands-on experience with <strong>Python, Django, SQL, HTML, CSS</strong>,
        and I’ve worked on projects like a <strong>Restaurant Management System</strong>
        and this portfolio website.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’ve completed multiple certifications and virtual job simulations from platforms
        like <strong>TATA Forage, Deloitte Forage, and AWS</strong>,
        which helped me understand real industry workflows.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’m currently seeking opportunities where I can grow as a
        <strong>Data Analyst / Software Developer</strong>,
        contribute to meaningful projects, and continue learning from experienced teams.
    </p>
